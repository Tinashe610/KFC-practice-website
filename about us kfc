Our food is always craveable. We are the original fried chicken experts, and everything we do celebrates our passion for serving finger lickin’ good food. Whether it’s a spin on our world-famous iconic recipes, innovative ways to serve fried chicken, or new menu items inspired by our original roots, everything we make must be uniquely KFC. We’re proud to serve wholesome, abundant, hot meals the way they should be served—made with high-quality fresh chicken, freshly prepared by real cooks in our kitchens.

OUR RESTAURANTS
We’re not about novelty for novelty’s sake. We have deep roots and we have an original founder. We cook our chicken from scratch and our restaurants celebrate that story. We use natural, high-quality materials and have all the conveniences to make our guests feel welcome and comfortable. From our table designs to the sounds in our restaurants, we create a friendly and lively place that makes you want to stay and enjoy your time with friends or family. We are always evolving in the name of chicken, from innovating new ways to order to creating exciting new restaurant formats, we are not afraid to constantly try new things that make it easier to enjoy our chicken.
